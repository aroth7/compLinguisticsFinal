# README Computational Liguistics Final Project (option 2)
OVERVIEW:
For my final project, I chose option 2, making a BERT Question-Answering System. This repo contains the .ipynb file for the colab where I wrote my code (and a .py version). To run the code, one must first run every cell, and then run the main function. Also, in the load_data function, the file paths currently match where I had the data stored in my google drive in order to be abe to run it locally, so those would have to be changed.

Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mu4KBwEFKW5R3mM6zN9imA_lbPROEdxd/view?usp=drive_link) to my video.
